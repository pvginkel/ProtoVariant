This project contains a simple VARIANT implementation with protobuf-net. The idea
is to allow you to easilly add properties to a protocol which do not have a
specific data type.

This implementation is optimized for message size. Most of the time, it just adds
one byte overhead.

This project was inspired by a question placed on StackOverflow which can
be found at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6519533/how-to-implement-variant-in-protobuf.
