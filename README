This project contains a simple VARIANT implementation with protobuf-net. The
idea is to allow you to easilly add properties to a protocol which do not have
a specific data type.

This implementation is optimized for message size and memory consumption. Most
of the time, it just adds one byte overhead and the class contains a single
Object field to store its data.

This project was inspired by a question placed on StackOverflow which can be
found at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6519533/how-to-implement-variant-in-protobuf.
